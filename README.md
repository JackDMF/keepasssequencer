# keepasssequencer

## Getting Started

Have a look at the [wiki for the user documentation](https://github.com/fireout/keepasssequencer/wiki)

You can run from the bin/Release folder, if you stick a copy of KeePass.exe.config there.

Generated passwords will be empty until you configure some settings. You can do this from within the app, or by copying the options.xml or 
SamplePasswordSequenceConfiguration.xml from the project root directory into one of the paths specified in the Sequencer.dll.config file.

## Source Code

Most recent code reside within the [develop](https://github.com/fireout/keepasssequencer/tree/develop) branch.
