# keepasssequencer
Need to copy the appSettings from Sequencer.dll.config to KeePass.exe.config in
order to run.

You can run from the bin/Release folder, if you stick a copy of
KeePass.exe.config there.

Configuration requires an options.xml file, based on (or copied from)
SamplePasswordSequenceConfiguration.xml. Without it the app won't work.
