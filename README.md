# keepasssequencer
Need to copy the appSettings from Sequencer.dll.config to KeePass.exe.config in
order to run.

You can run from the bin/Release folder, if you stick a copy of
KeePass.exe.config there.

Generated passwords will be empty until you configure some settings. You can do this from within the app, or by copying the options.xml or SamplePasswordSequenceConfiguration.xml from the project root directory into one of the paths specified in the Sequencer.dll.config file.
